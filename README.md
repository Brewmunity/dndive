## How it came to be
I was annoyed by some of the tools online having important features stuck behind paywalls.

Yes, I know there are tools online for most of the stuff DnDive provides, but I miss the connection between the tools.
What I want to achieve with DnDive is a centralized site for everything one needs and for every scenario one encounters when DMing or playing a campaign.

Feature requests as well as bug reports are much appreciated!
